# C\# & .NET Live Project
 Showing the work I did within the C# and .NET Two week Live Project updating a MVC web app. For the two weeks I was part of team working to update some features per the request of the "cilent". Within this project I used C#, .NET, Entity framework, CSS and many other to meet the "cilent's" requirements.
